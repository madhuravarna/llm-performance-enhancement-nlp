# llm-performance-enhancement-nlp
A project focused on evaluating and improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) using NLP datasets. Involves fine-tuning, prompt engineering, data preprocessing, and model comparison to enhance results on language understanding tasks.


This project explores strategies to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by fine-tuning them on a curated NLP dataset. The goal is to improve results on language classification, comprehension, or generation tasks through data preprocessing, prompt engineering, and model tuning.

## Results

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| BERT         | 88.5%    | 0.89      | 0.88   | 0.88     |
| DistilBERT   | 86.2%    | 0.87      | 0.86   | 0.86     |
| RoBERTa      | 89.3%    | 0.90      | 0.89   | 0.89     |
| Fine-tuned BERT | 91.2% | 0.92      | 0.91   | 0.91     |

## Future Work

- Explore LLaMA, GPT-J, or Mistral models
- Use RAG for open-domain QA tasks
- Integrate few-shot or zero-shot evaluations
- Deploy the best model via API or web app (e.g., Streamlit or Gradio)
